/**
 * Given a linked list A of length N.Each number is represented by 2 consecutive nodes of linked list.
 * suppose 2 ->7 ->5 ->6 is the given linked list. then the numbers are 27 and 56.
 * return the head of the sorted linked list.
 * Look at the examples for further clarifications.
 *
 * Problem constraints :
 * 1 <=N<=100000
 * N is always even.
 * Input:first argument is the head pointer of the linked list.
 * Output:head point of the sorted linked list.
 *
 * Example: Input : 5-> 1 -> 0 -> 3
 * Output: 0 -> 3 ->5-> 1
 * Example explanation: first number is 51. second number is 03
 * after sorting linked list becomes 0 -> 3 ->5-> 1
