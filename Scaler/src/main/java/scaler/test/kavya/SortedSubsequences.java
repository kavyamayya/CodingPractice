/**
 * Given a string A of length N consisting of lower case characters only.Return the count of subsequences
 * of the given string in which  the characters are lexicographically sorted.
 * Empty subsequences are not counted in the answer.
 * Note:Return the answer modulo 100000007 as the answer can be very large.
 *
 * Problem constraints
 * 1<=N<=100000
 *
 * Input format-String A
 * Output - integer denoting the count of lexicograhically sorted subsequences in the string
 *
 * Example: A = "aba";
 * output: 5
 * Explanation: Every single character in the string {a,b,a} is a sorted subsequence of the string.SO COUNT=3.
 * "ab" and "aa" are sorted subsequences of length2 of the given string.count becomes 5.There is no sorted subsequence of length 3.
