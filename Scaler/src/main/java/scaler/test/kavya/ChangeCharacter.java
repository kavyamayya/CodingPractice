/**
 * Given a string A of size N consisting of lowercase alphabets.
 * You can change atmost B characters in the given string to any other lower case alphabet such that number of distinct
 * characters in the string is minimized.Find the minimum number of distinct characters in the given string.
 *
 * problem constraints:
 * 1<=N<=100000
 * 0<=B<N
 *Input:
 * first argument Integer A
 * second argument Integer B
 * Output: return integer denoting minimum number of distinct characters in the string.
 * @author kavya k on 01-Mar-2020
 *
 * Example input:
 * A="abcabbccd"
 * B=3
 * Output:2
 * we can change both a and d into b. so new string becomes "bbcbbbccb".So min number of distinct characters will be 2.
